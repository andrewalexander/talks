# Software Engineering Summit 2017
## Serverless Workshop

This repo houses the code for the two of the guided walkthroughs of some "hello-world"-type projects using serverless architectures. 

It includes:
 - An Arduino project that includes code for a potentiometer that both controls a light as well as send a message to a serverless application to trigger an alert or take further action.
 - A sample web application and set of backend code to upload an image, automatically generate a thumbnail, and display that thumbnail on the current page. 
  * This could use a lot of work :D
 - A link to another talk/walkthrough of an API that talks to a database on your behalf
